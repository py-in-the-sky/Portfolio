## Artificial Intelligence

My AI projects, including those I completed during the [Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/ai) (AIND)

TODO:
Link to AIND and related projects, including Pac Man and [Intermediate Word Search](https://github.com/py-in-the-sky/challenges/tree/master/intermediate_words_search_python) (spruce up intermediate word search and add own heap)

Examples:
* [AIND-Isolation](https://github.com/py-in-the-sky/AIND-Isolation): implements a game player for the adversarial game of [Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isola_(board_game)).
  * Language: Python.
  * Algorithms and data structures implemented: minimax search, alpha-beta pruning, breadth-first search, bit manipulation.
* [A\* word search](https://github.com/py-in-the-sky/challenges/tree/master/intermediate_words_search_python): solves a word puzzle defined over the English dictionary.
  * Language: Python.
  * Algorithms and data structures implemented: A\*, trie, heap, edit distance (dynamic programming).
